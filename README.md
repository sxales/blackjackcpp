# BlackJack

Inspired by the 80s arcade game poker ladies. 

I originally made this for Android because I wanted a blackjack app that didn't have a bunch of ads in it. I made this C++ port just because I was bored, so don't expect too much. It is rough around the edges and it was originally designed for touchscreen, but it is functional video poker.

TABLE RULES:

  - Blackjack pays 3/2
  - No doubledown after split
  - Dealer stands on 17 (including soft-17)
  - 4 decks, shuffled before every hand

HOW TO PLAY:

Start with one of eleven dealers. 

Each hand played earns affection, which gradually unlocks new dealer portraits. 

If you run out of money in the bank, you have to start over from the begining. 

TIP: If you don't know whether to hit or stay, you can click the dealer for a hint.
